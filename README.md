Migrated from Savor theme, implementing a simple callout style.

- Providing a button in a quote block's icon menu, click it to convert the quote block into a callout.
- The content of the first child block of the quote block will be displayed as the title in the callout.
- - A new callout block can also be created with the `/` command.
  - `/bq-{callout id}`
  - `/callout-{callout id}`

## Callout Icons

This plugin uses emoji icons for displaying callout icons.

Since the default emoji display in SiYuan is not very good, it is recommended to download the Emoji plugin from the market to get better display effects.

You can manually configure the "Callout Emoji Font" field in the plugin's settings to set the priority of the icon style. The default value is:

```
'Twitter Emoji', 'Noto Color Emoji', 'OpenMoji', sans-serif
```
